Simpl3Mian is a simple-text program. I made this because I wanted to count quadratic function faster. I guess, It can helps other people :).
Simpl3Mian is using polish language but it's easy to change printf functions and add words in your language.

It's a simple program made in C language. I made ready-to-use .exe file for Windows users but Simpl3Mian is an open-source project so You can download Source Code and compile on your OS, for example Ubuntu.
